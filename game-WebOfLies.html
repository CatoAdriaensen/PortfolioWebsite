            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Web of lies</strong> is a <strong>small game jam project</strong> 
                my team and I created for the <strong>2025 Unwrap jam.</strong>
                The jam lasted for about two days, and the theme was <strong>"Spreading it".</strong>
                I was one of two <strong>game designers.</strong>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Game</h2>
            <p>
                In this game, <strong>you and a friend</strong> find yourselves in an <strong>office with a detective</strong>.
                Neither of you know why you're there, a sudden case of <strong>amnesia?</strong> Whatever it may be, 
                the detective questions you both about <strong>a murder case</strong>, and he wants answers now!
                You'll both need to come up with an <strong>alibi</strong> and stick to it,
                while also <strong>remembering each other's story.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>core gameplay</strong> involves <strong>answering the detective's questions</strong> by picking from a set of options in real time, 
                while trying to stay <strong>consistent</strong> with the <strong>alibi</strong> you created together.
                This game <strong>tests</strong> the players <strong>memories and trust.</strong>
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Can you keep your stories straight, or will you get caught in your <strong>own web of lies?</strong>
                Will you rat out your friend for a crime you might not have even commited
                or will you stick together until the end?
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Important note</h2>
            <p>
                This game is still <strong>in development</strong> due to several <strong>bugs and technical issues</strong> 
                that currently make it <strong>difficult to play properly</strong>.
                Because of this I will mostly focus on discussing the design choices behind the game.
                <br>
                However, I wanted to share it because it <strong>ranked 2# for best idea out of 30</strong> in the jam, and 
                I'm confident that once the bugs are fixed, the game will <strong>really shine.</strong>

                <li>
                    <p><strong> Suspicion meter</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    Each player has a <strong>suspicion meter</strong> that shows how suspicious they are at any moment.
                    The meter is simple,
                    <br>
                    A <strong>wrong</strong> answer will <strong>increase the player's meter,</strong>
                    and if it becomes <strong>full,</strong> the detective will assume <strong>they're guilty.</strong>
                    <br>
                    A <strong>correct</strong> answer will <strong>decrease the meter,</strong>
                    and if it becomes <strong>empty,</strong> the detective will assume <strong>they're innocent.</strong>

                    <p><strong> Core questions structure</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    We wanted to include a <strong>variety of questions,</strong> 
                    but before that, we needed to establish the core questions structure.
                    Each question falls into one of <strong>four one core categories</strong>, each with four possible answers.
                    </p>
                    <ol style="font-size: x-large;">
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Who?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                These questions asks what the player's <strong>job</strong> is.
                                This is a simple way of giving the player an identity without needing a full backstory.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>What?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                These questions asks <strong>what activity</strong> the player was doing at the time of the murder.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Where?</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                These questions asks the player's <strong>location</strong> during the time of the murder.
                            </p>
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Relationship</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                These questions asks what the player's <strong>relationship </strong>to the victim was.
                            </p>
                        </li> 
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        To help the detective quickly and easily focus on and refer to a specific player,
                        we gave each character a unique name. 
                        <div class="row">
                            <div>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each player also gets the same questions but in different orders, 
                        to prevent players from just copying previous answers.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
                <li>
                    <p><strong> Two phases</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    The game is divided into <strong>two phases,</strong> both of which use the <strong>same core questions</strong> as a <strong>base</strong>:
                    </p>
                    <ol style="font-size: x-large;">
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>The story building phase</strong></p>
                            <p>
                                Both players build their <strong>alibi</strong> by answering the detective's questions.
                                <br>
                                The questions in these phase are <strong>short and simple,</strong> designed to <strong>gather</strong> the core <strong>information.</strong>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>The questioning phase</strong></p>  
                            <p>
                                The detective tries to <strong>catch one of the players in a lie</strong> by <strong>questioning</strong> what was said earlier 
                                and looking for any inconsistencies.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This phase really <strong>tests players.</strong>
                                They must <strong>remember their answers</strong> from the first phase 
                                to correctly <strong>answer in this phase.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Design choices</strong> for phase two questions:
                            </p>
                            <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Sometimes, players get asked <strong>yes or no questions</strong>, which have two possible answers.
                                        These usually has the detective make an assumption 
                                        that the player either confirms or denies.
                                        <div class="row">

                                    <p>
                                        Every question, the <strong>detective responds based</strong> on whether the answer was <strong>correct or not</strong> to make it seem more like a real interrogation.
                                        The detective's responses is a mix between serious and funny to keep the overall tone light.
                                        Sometimes, the detective asks a small follow up question.
                                    </p>
                                </li>

                                Beyond the basics, we've also designed some questions to make the players challenge 
                                their <strong>memory, loyalty and trust</strong> in one another.
                            </p>

                                    <p>
                                        These are the simple basic questions from before but now they are asked to one player about the other.
                                        This forces the players to try to <strong>remember each other alibi</strong>, not just their own.

                    We were inspired by the <strong>Wii Party friendship test</strong> controls. 
                    The <strong>core concept</strong> was that both players had to <strong>answer the same questions
                    without knowing</strong> what the <strong>other answered</strong> until the answers were revealed.
                    We thought this was a great way to allow players to <strong>possibly betray each other</strong>,
                    for example, one player blaming the other player.

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    We planned on implementing this concept with <strong>xbox controllers</strong>.
                    However, due to <strong>time constraints</strong>, we weren't able to implement this.
                    <br>
                    Instead, the players <strong>share one mouse</strong>, switching it whenever it's their turn to answer.
