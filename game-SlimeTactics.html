            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Slime tactics</strong> is a <strong>small solo game design project</strong> I created for my Game Design 3 class.
                The assignment required students to <strong>brainstorm multiple game concepts</strong> based on different themes and turn at least one into a <strong>prototype</strong> every two weeks. 
                The main focus was <strong>game design.</strong>
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Game</h2>
            <p>
                In this game, <strong>your goal</strong> is to <strong>separate yourself from the immortal yellow snail</strong> by using death as your advantage in a small cave.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you <strong>collide</strong> with a <strong>red snail</strong>, you <strong>"die"</strong> and <strong>respawn in the main area.</strong>
                Your <strong>body</strong> that's been left behind <strong>transforms into a wall.</strong>
                Using this mechanic strategically, you have to block the three tunnels leading into the main area.
            </p>
            <p>
                To <strong>win,</strong> you must be in the <strong>main area</strong> with all three entrances blocked off
                <strong>without the yellow immortal snail inside,</strong> because if you collide with the immortail snail, it's <strong>game over!</strong>
            </p>

            <h2>Core design Choices</h2>
            <br>
            <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
                <li>
                    <p><strong> Snails</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    The snails spawn in a <strong>random location</strong> on the map, ensuring that every playthrough is unique.
                    There are <strong>two kinds</strong> of snails, each with distinct behaviors:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Yellow immortal snail</strong></p>
                            <p>
                            Never stops <strong>following the player</strong> wherever, creating constant pressure.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><strong>Red snail</strong></p>
                            <p>
                            Remains <strong>passive until</strong> the player enters its <strong>detection radius.</strong>
                            <br>
                            The player must <strong>lure red snails</strong> into specific positions to use them strategicaly.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="c-game col-sm-6">
                        <img class="c-game__img c-game__img--variation" src="img/SlimeTactics/SlimeTactics_Sc_yellowSnail.png" alt="SlimeTactics_yellowSnail">

            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
                <li>
                    <p><strong> Player respawn</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    Having the player <strong>respawn back</strong> into the <strong>main area</strong> whenever they collide with a red snail creates <strong>chaos, unpredictability and excitement.</strong>
                    <br>They constantly have to <strong>re-orient themselves</strong> and find their way through the cave again.
                    Players also need to <strong>plan their actions</strong> carefully to avoid potentially respawning when the yellow snail is in the center, as it poses a serious threat.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
                <li>
                    <p><strong> Four walls</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    The player has only <strong>four walls</strong>, this constraint forces them to think strategically on how to block off the main area from the immortal snail.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
                <li>
                    <p><strong> 3D and first-person view</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    A 3D, first-person perspective is the best fit for this kind of game.
                    It <strong>immerses</strong> the player and it helps create the feeling of <strong>being trapped with an immortal snail.</strong>
                    This builds tension and can turn into <strong>excitement and adrenaline.</strong>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
                <li>
                    <p><strong> Level design</strong></p>
                    <p>
                    After I came up with the core idea, I designed a <strong>simple map</strong> in photoshop to support the gameplay mechanics.
                    Since the game's design relies heavily on the level layout to make the game fun, this was an important step.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I designed the map with <strong>interconnected tunnels</strong> to increase frequent snail encounters
                    and to give players a wider range of strategic options.
                    </p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div>
                            <img class="c-game__img c-game__img--variation" src="img/SlimeTactics/LevelDesign.jpg" alt="SlimeTactics_LevelDesign">

                    <br>
                    <p>
                    After that, I went to unity for implementation.
                    Eventually, after some playtesting and iteration,
                    the final map turned out like this:
                    <div class="row">
                        <div>
                            <img class="c-game__img c-game__img--variation" src="img/SlimeTactics/Final_LevelDesign.png">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>  
            <br>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    During early brainstorming to improve the core concept, I ended up with <strong>two different versions</strong> of the game:
                </p>
                    <ul style="font-size: x-large;">
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Whenever the <strong>player collides</strong> with a <strong>red snail</strong>, the player <strong>"dies", respawns</strong> at the main area, and their left behind <strong>body transforms into a wall.</strong>
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Red snails gets transformed into a wall</strong> whenever the player collides with them. The player does <strong>not get respawned</strong> at the main area.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I prototyped and playtested both versions with a variety of playtesters. 
                        After collecting feedback, I evaluated each version based on these <strong>three points,</strong> 
                        which helped me decide which version to continue with:
                    </p>
                    <ol style="font-size: x-large;">
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                How fun was it to play?

                                How long does the experience remain engaging for the player?
